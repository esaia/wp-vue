                Hey it's Esaia, author of this course ðŸ‘‹
            </p>

            <p>
                I built a
                <a href="http://www.ireplugin.com" target="_blank">
                    WordPress plugin
                </a>
                that generates passive income. And decided to share my knowledge
                and experience for you.
            </p>

            </a>

            <p>
                I shipped
                <a href="http://www.ireplugin.com" target="_blank">
                    Interactive Real Estate
                </a>
                in February 2025, and just one weeks after the launch, I made my
                <span> first sale ðŸ’¸</span>. At first, I thought it was just a
                test payment that I made myself, but a week later, I realized it
                was real. I was shocked ðŸ¤¯! I hadn't even started
                <span> marketing</span> or posted anything on social media. I
                had simply uploaded it to the
                <a
                    href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/interactive-real-estate/"
                    target="_blank"
                >
                    official WordPress repository.
                </a>
                That's the <span> power</span> of WordPress. It has very large
                community.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, I earn <span> passive income</span> from that plugin, and
                if I can do it, you can too.
            </p>

                class="shadow"
            />
            <img
                src="/images/first-payment.webp"
                alt="first payment"
                class="shadow"
            />

            <p>
                While building my plugin, I realized there was plenty of
                information on how to use WordPress and its plugins, but very
                little on how to actually create them. That's why I made this
                course.
