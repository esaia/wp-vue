                Hey it's Esaia, author of this course ðŸ‘‹
            </p>

            <p>
                I built a
                <a href="http://www.ireplugin.com" target="_blank">
                    WordPress plugin
                </a>
                that generates passive income. And decided to share my knowledge
                and experience for you.

            <p>
                I shipped
                <a href="http://www.ireplugin.com" target="_blank">
                    Interactive Real Estate
                </a>
                in February 2025, and just one weeks after the launch, I made my
                <span> first sale ðŸ’¸</span>. At first, I thought it was just a
                test payment that I made myself, but a week later, I realized it
                was real. I was shocked ðŸ¤¯! I hadn't even started
                <span> marketing</span> or posted anything on social media. I
                had simply uploaded it to the
                <a
                    href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/interactive-real-estate/"
                    target="_blank"
                >
                    official WordPress repository.
                </a>
                That's the <span> power</span> of WordPress. It has very large
                community.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, I earn <span> passive income</span> from that plugin, and
                if I can do it, you can too. I made this course to share my
                experience.

            />

            <p>
                While building my plugin, I realized there was plenty of
                information on how to use WordPress and its plugins, but very
                little on how to actually create them. That's why I made this
                course.
            </p>

            <p>
                This course will give you the knowledge to build
                <span>any plugin you want.</span> What you'll need next is
                simply a <span>good idea.</span> I'll show you the exact
                blueprint I used to develop my successful
                <a href="http://www.ireplugin.com" target="_blank">
                    interactive real estate
                </a>
                plugin. You'll finish with a ready-to-customize boilerplate,
                allowing you to launch your own plugins faster than ever by
                reusing proven code. The only limit is
                <span>your creativity!</span>
            </p>

            <p>Don't waitâ€”start learning today!</p>

            <p>Because after this course, you will say:</p>

            <h3 class="title-md">What we will build</h3>

            <p>
                In this course, we'll build a powerful, professional-grade
                slider plugin from the ground up. You'll create a fully-featured
                admin area where you can manage all your sliders with ease,
                including a dedicated table with pagination and full CRUD
                (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Inside the slider configuration, you'll implement a rich suite
                of features:
            </p>

            <ul class="space-y-3 text-left">
                <li>
                    <b>- Drag & Drop Ordering:</b> Intuitively arrange your
                    slides.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>- Dynamic Animations:</b> Choose from effects like Fade,
                    Cube, Flip, Coverflow, and more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>- Full Customization:</b> Control spacing, direction
                    (vertical/horizontal), and modules like Autoplay,
                    Navigation, and Pagination.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                On the front-end, we'll leverage the powerful
                <span>Swiper.js package</span>
                to bring our sliders to life. You'll learn to create a dynamic
                shortcode that renders a unique slider based on its
                configuration, giving you total creative freedom.
            </p>
